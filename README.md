# Locomotive

Locomotive is a framework that brings structure and MVC patterns to web
applications using [Node](http://nodejs.org) and [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

## Quick Start

`lcm`, the command line interface to Locomotive, can be used to generate a
starter application.  To use it, install Locomotive globally.

Next, create an application and install dependencies.

    $ lcm create foo
    $ cd foo
    $ npm install
    
Start the server.

The application is available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
